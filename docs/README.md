ReNova — Documentation

This docs folder contains concise developer-facing documentation for the ReNova project (frontend + backend). Read these files to get a quick understanding of the architecture, key components, how to run the project locally, and troubleshooting tips.

Files:
- `architecture.md` — High-level architecture and data flows (user and recycler flows).
- `quickstart.md` — How to run backend and frontend locally, required env vars.
- `api_endpoints.md` — Key HTTP endpoints used by the frontend and mobile clients.
- `troubleshooting.md` — Known issues and quick fixes (httpx/groq conflict, translation choices).

Use this as the single source for onboarding new contributors and for hackathon demos.
